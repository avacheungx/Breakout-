      <h1> Breakout!</h1>
      <h2> Created By: Juno Cheung</h2>
      <p id="description"> Breakout! is a fast-paced arcade-style game where quick reflexes and sharp hand-eye coordination are key! 
        Take control of a paddle as you bounce a colorful ball and chase after shiny treasures floating across the screen. 
        But beware—missing the ball will cost you your score and send you back to square one! Collect treasures to rack up 
        points and watch the colors of your ball shift and swirl as you keep it in play. How many points can you collect before missing your shot?</p>
      <h3>Instructions:</h3>
      <p>Objective:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep the ball bouncing using your paddle, avoid letting it fall off the bottom of the screen, and collect as many treasures as you can to increase your score.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Controls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move Paddle: Use the A key to move left and the D key to move right.</li>
        <li>Start the Game: Click the mouse to launch the ball.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Gameplay:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Once the game starts, the ball will bounce around the screen. Use your paddle to keep it in play by deflecting it back up.</li>
        <li>Collect treasures by colliding the ball with them—each one is worth 1 point!</li>
        <li>Treasures will randomly appear on opposite sides of the screen and move diagonally. Keep an eye on their movement!</li>
        <li>The longer you keep the ball in play, the faster it may bounce, adding to the challenge!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>End Game:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If the ball falls below your paddle and misses, your score will reset to zero, and you'll have to start over from the top. Good luck!</li>
      </ul>
